Welcome to my one-page site hosted on GitHub. It is completely free and can be used without restrictions, although a mention of the author is welcome. The site was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the JS script, I used the particles.js library, the link to which can be found below. I encourage you to explore my site and use it as you see fit. Keep in mind that this is a demonstration page, if you want a finished full page take a look at my fiver link below.
